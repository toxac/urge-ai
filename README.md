### Art of Asking
Asking someone for help, feedback, or a quick introduction seems straightforward and simple, but in practice, most people find it very hard. Asking makes us vulnerable. This vulnerability stems from two main concerns: First, we are never sure how to approach someone, and second, we are consumed by the thought of them saying no. There is a voice in our heads that whispers, “You’ll look needy,” “It will be annoying,” or “You are not good enough.”
Remember, “If you don't ask, the answer is already no.” There is a real cost to not asking for things: missed opportunities, slower progress, and endless guessing. Most successful people are good at asking—be it for a raise, investment, a new connection, or maybe asking someone out on a date. We will break this process down and demystify it for you.

Elements of a Great Ask
know what you want (before asking)
There are times I've been stopped by people who have told me long stories about problems and what they are doing to solve them. Even though these stories are captivating, I can’t help but think, “Why are you telling me this?” and “What, exactly, do you want from me?” Often, we are so consumed in getting things done that we forget to ask ourselves, “What specific thing do I need someone to do for me?”
Before you consider asking people, take your time to rethink, reflect, and figure out precisely what you need. Walk through the following everyday scenarios to understand needs.
Scenario 1: The Networking Follow-Up 
Imagine you’ve just left a networking event. You spoke to a successful professional, and they mentioned they use a specific resource list or internal document that would massively help your current project.

The Broad Impulse: You think, "I need to connect with them and learn everything they know! I should ask them to lunch."
The vague need here is: General mentorship/connection.
Refining the Need: Wait. You don't need their life story or an hour of their time—you need that specific document or resource recommendation. Their time is expensive.
The exact need is: A single, focused piece of information delivered digitally.
The Great Ask is Framed As: A simple email requesting one specific, low-effort item (a link, a document, or the name of a book) that shows you respect their expertise and their calendar.
Scenario 2: The Project Help 
Imagine you’re racing against a deadline for a personal project—say, creating a professional portfolio—and you hit a wall. Your roommate is a graphic designer, and their visual skills are far superior to yours.
The Broad Impulse: You feel overwhelmed and want to hand the whole messy problem off. You think, "I need them to take over and fix the design."
The vague need here is: Relief from stress and a major project overhaul.
Refining the Need: Stop and realise they have their own deadlines. The true bottleneck isn't the whole project; it's a specific aesthetic decision. You can narrow this down to the hardest part for you.
The exact need is: An expert judgment on a limited, pre-prepared set of options.
The Great Ask is Framed As: A request for one hour of targeted feedback this Saturday to choose between five pre-selected font and colour combinations. You define the task and the clock.
Understand the Purpose (The Why)
You have understood the “what” of the ask, and now you must think about the “why.” Before reaching out to people, you need to check why you need that particular help. Just because you have learned how to ask for things doesn't mean you start asking for everything. Your internal conviction and purpose will lend authenticity to your request.


Actually Asking 
Now comes the most obvious—and often most difficult—part: actually approaching someone and asking. You should observe people asking you for something from now on. Notice how they try to tell a story, give you a long background, ask if you are okay, and if your family is fine. In between all that talk, they squeeze in their ask. You are left confused; even if you were able to figure out what they needed, you can’t tell how serious or urgent it was.
Be clear, specific  and direct 
Make your ask very clear and simple. Be very direct about what you want from them, when you need it, and what it will help you accomplish. The person you are asking for help from should know the following:
What do they have to do to complete your request? 
How much time/money will it require?
When do you expect them to do it?
How will it help you?
Example: Asking for feedback on your landing page
You have to give them the link to the page
A form/set of questions for feedback
It would take 10 minutes
This will help finalise your launch
Be selective in whom to ask 
Not everyone will be in a position to help you. Let's say you are trying to research how frequently people take public transport in your city; asking people who are not in your city will not be helpful. Targeted asking respects others' time and dramatically increases your success rate.
Ask multiple times and in different ways 
We are connected in so many ways today. We communicate through email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and through so many other apps. Not everyone uses each of these apps the same way. It might be useful to send your ask through different targeted channels. You should also message them multiple times. Be sure not to spam anyone. A good practical trick is to craft your message suited for different platforms (e.g., a brief, direct LinkedIn message versus a more detailed email). You should also vary your messages if you're sending more than one message to a person using the same platform.
You Can Be Audacious 
If you don't ask, you don't get. Be brave!
Audacity in asking isn't about being rude or demanding; it's about having unwavering belief in the value of what you're requesting, regardless of how big or unusual it seems. Think of the small, confident askers mentioned earlier—they build their asking muscle over time.
Push yourself beyond your comfort zone and try asking for things that feel slightly outside the norm (like a discount, an upgrade, or an introduction to a highly influential person).
Practice Makes Audacious: Every small, successful ask (even for a free extra napkin) builds the confidence needed for the big asks (like a major raise or a large investment).
Assume the Yes: When you ask, assume the person would be delighted to help you. People often respond to your energy. If you are confident, they are more likely to take the request seriously. 
Things to pay attention to 
Your ask exists within a specific time and place. Paying attention to these external cues can significantly influence the response.
Context and Surroundings
People are heavily influenced by their physical and mental state when making decisions.
Subtle Cues: Researchers have found that physical sensations can impact decision-making. For example, asking for a favour while sitting at a comfortable table may yield a different result than asking across a chaotic, crowded space. While you can't control everything, create the most neutral and comfortable setting possible.
Minimise Distraction: For important, complex asks, ensure the other person is not distracted by noise, their phone, or other pressing tasks. Your clear message should be the only thing they are focusing on.
Right Time to Ask 
Decision fatigue is real. People's willpower and capacity for making complex choices deplete throughout the day.
Morning vs. Evening: For complicated asks (negotiating salary, making a big pitch), aim for the morning when the person's mental energy is fresh. You are more likely to get a "yes," or at least a thoughtful consideration, before they are exhausted by the day's obligations.
Starting Small: If you are asking for something significant, start with an incremental ask—a small commitment that builds rapport and responsibility. Don't ask for the entire partnership before establishing trust with a simple, successful collaboration.
Avoid terrible asks, be kind, and make sure you say thank you
The final phase ensures you handle the interaction with grace, whether the answer is yes or no.
Avoid Terrible Asks
The worst asks are those that are vague, non-specific, and open-ended, requiring the responder to do all the work.
The "Pick Your Brain" Trap: Never ask, "Can I take you to lunch and pick your brain?" This gives the responder no idea how long it will take, what they should prepare for, or if they can even be useful.
The Solution: If you must ask for time, provide a clear agenda. For instance, "I'm facing one specific hurdle with my marketing strategy. I need 15 minutes of your time to review three possible solutions I've prepared. I promise to stick to the clock."

Be Kind and Say Thank You
The transaction doesn't end when the response is given.
Make Them Feel Good: When someone agrees to help, express genuine gratitude and let them know how helpful their specific contribution was. People want to feel effective.
Follow Up and Follow Through: Always close the loop. If they gave you a resource, use it and then send a quick note sharing the outcome ("Thanks to that document you shared, I saved 10 hours this week!"). This validates their time and makes them highly likely to say "yes" to your next ask.
The Final Word: Whether they say yes or no, always say thank you for their time and consideration. Kindness is the foundation of future connection.
